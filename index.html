                    <p>Hi. Im Nika. I live in georgia, I'm 14 and I absolutely love scripting. I enjoy Roblox game development along with WEB development, something about it brings so much excitment. I've been scripting for around 4 years and I love learning new stuff about programming daily.</p>

                            <p class="info">I have been scripting on roblox for 3 years. Throughout those years I've learned how to make some really amazing systems and features. I don't only script but I also have a good amount of experience in building, modeling, UI, ect. I got interested in by spending hours and days grinding and playing various games on roblox. when I saw them I got curious how they were made and I also wanted to create my own cool game where I could build and script whatever I wanted!! At the moment I have contributed a lot of games. one of them having 20M and other with over a Million.</p>

                            <p class="info">Web development is kind of new to me but its fun! It has only been around a month that I started learning it and I guess you can already tell my current skill level. Before making this website, I looked for a tutorial on how to make it and after watching it I decided to make my version, without looking at the tutorial script at all.</p>
